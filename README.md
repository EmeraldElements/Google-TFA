# Two-Factor-Authentication
Two-Factor Authentication for Orchard CMS

This module aims to add a full featured Two-Factor Authentication suite to Orchard CMS. Two-Factor Authentication has been coded to work with the Google Authenticator app.

Features Include:
=================
1. Site level settings - Enable/disable features for the site/force requirements on user settings.
2. User level settings - Enable/disable features per user
3. Reset secret key and verify correct set up of TFA
4. Administrators can allow users to login without TFA if problems are encountered.
5. Backup SMS/Email functionality (SMS uses Twilio)
6. QR-Code for easy integration into Google's Authenticator app
7. User profile area for managing TFA settings.

This is an initial release so please inform me of any bugs and I'll try to fix them as I get time. Also feel free to contribute if you are so inclined.
